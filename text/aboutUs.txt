Cameron Dansie and Bret Gold founded FightPrep because they kept running into the same problems time and time again in the sports for which they have an extreme passion. Competing at some of the highest levels in both wrestling and Jiu Jitsu, they noticed themselves and other athletes consistently struggling with similar obstacles. Cutting weight, being ready to perform after a weight cut, arm pump, maintaining energy for multiple fights, and recovering after difficult training and fights.

They were perplexed that there wasn’t a legitimate solution to combat these problems contributing to sub-par performances from athletes. That’s when the lightbulb light up and the idea of FightPrep was born.

Cameron and Bret began working with a doctor to design multiple FightPrep products exactly for the purpose of optimizing the human body for ultimate performance, with 100% natural ingredients. Each one of FightPrep’s ingredients has a specific purpose in order to achieve maximum performance.
